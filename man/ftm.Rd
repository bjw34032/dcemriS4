\title{Fast Template Matching via Cross-Correlation}
\usage{
\S4method{ftmarray}(input, ...)

\S4method{ftm}{array}(input, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{is a four-dimensional array of signal intensities.}

\item{...}{Additional variables passed to the \code{plot} function.}
}
\value{
A list of objects are returned: \item{out}{Motion-corrected version
of the four-dimensional array.} \item{offset}{Translations (in 3D) for each
volume in the 4D array.} \item{t.center}{Estimated center of the binary
mask.}
}
\description{
Motion correction and/or co-registration of three-dimensional arrays
(medical imaging data) are performed by applying a user-defined mask of
voxels.  Normalized cross-correlations (in 3D) are computed using the FFT.
}
\details{
An extremely basic method of motion correction/co-registration is
implemented by estimating \dQuote{local} cross-correlations based on a
binary mask that is a subset of the original three-dimensional volume.  All
convolutions are preformed via the FFT (\code{\link{fft}}) and repetitive
calculations are minimized where possible.

Only whole-voxel translations are considered.  This does not begin to
capture the true effects of motion in soft tissue, but we assume that the
object of interest (e.g., tumor) is a fairly rigid structure.  Potential
extensions include rigid-body, affine and nonlinear registration techniques
along with interploation schemes in order to capture intra-voxel
manipulations of the data.
