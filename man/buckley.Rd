\title{Simulated Data from Buckley (2002)}
\description{
  In Buckley (2002) tissue residue curves for a Meningioma and a Breast
  Cancer were simulated using the MMID4 model. Note, the model is
  described in detail by Bassingthwaighte, J.B. \emph{et al.} (1984) and
  Kroll, K \emph{et al.} (1996).  This model accounts for flow
  dispersion and heterogeneity, and includes capillaries modeled as
  axially distributed blood-tissue exchange units.  A plasma
  concentration-time curve, AKA arterial input function, was simulated
  as an input to the model using measurements made by Fritz-Hansen
  \emph{et al.} (1996).

\format{
  Two lists are created (breast and meningioma) that contain the
  simulated time curves and all associated kinetic parameter values.
