\section{Introduction}

Quantitative analysis of perfusion imaging using dynamic
contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is achieved through a series of
processing steps, starting with the raw data acquired from the MRI
scanner, and involves a combination of physics, mathematics,
engineering and statistics.  The purpose of the \pkg{dcemriS4} package
is to provide a collection of functions that move the experimental
data through all steps of the data analysis pipeline using standard
data formats that may be visualized and manipulated across a wide
variety of software packages.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Data Input/Output}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Data Formats and Conversion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \pkg{dcemriS4} package requires incoming data to be in
the ANALYZE~7.5 or NIfTI formats.  Data conversion (e.g., from DICOM
to NIfTI) must be performed by the user before \pkg{dcemriS4} may be
used to summarize the data.  Several software packages allow
DICOM-to-NIfTI (or ANALYZE) conversion; e.g.,
\begin{itemize}
\item FreeSurfer (\url{surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu})
\item Xmedcon (\url{xmedcon.sourceforge.net})
\item MRIConvert (\url{lnci.oregon.edu/\~jolinda/MRIConvert})
\end{itemize}
This is by no means an exhaustive list of software available for DICOM
conversion.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{A Note on Axes and Orientation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The NIfTI format contains an implicit generalized spatial
transformation from the data co-ordinate system $(i,j,k)$ into a
real-space ``right-handed'' co-ordinate system.  In this real-space
system, the $(x,y,z)$ axes are \emph{usually} set such that $x$
increases from left to right, $y$ increases from posterior to anterior
and $z$ increases from inferior to superior.

At this point in time the \pkg{dcemriS4} package cannot apply an
arbitrary transform to the imaging data into $(x,y,z)$ space -- such a
transform may require non-integral indices and interpolation steps.
The package does accommodate straightforward transformations of imaging
data; e.g., setting the $x$-axis to increase from right to left
(neurological).  Future versions of \pkg{dcemriS4} will attempt to
address more complicated transformations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{NIfTI and ANALYZE data in S4}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A major improvement in the \pkg{dcemriS4} package is the fact that
standard medical imaging formats are stored in unique classes under
the S4 system.  Essentially, NIfTI and ANALYZE data are stored as
multi-dimensional arrays with extra slots created that capture the
format-specific header information.  The NIfTI class also has the
ability to read and write extensions that conform to the data format
standard.  Customized printing and validity-checking functions are
available to the user and every attempt is made to ensure that the
information from the multi-dimensional array is in agreement with the
header values.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Audit Trail}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Following on from the S4 implementation of both the NIfTI and Analyze
data formats, the ability to extend the NIfTI data format header is
utilized in the \pkg{dcemriS4} package.  First, extensions are
properly handled when reading and writing NIfTI data.  Second, users
are allowed to add extensions to newly-created NIfTI objects using
various functions and the \pkg{XML} package.  Third, by default all
operations that are performed on a NIfTI object will generate what we
call an \emph{audit trail} that consists of an XML-based log.  Each
log entry contains information not only about the function applied to
the NIfTI object, but also various system-level information; e.g.,
version of \proglang{R}, user name, date, time, etc.  When writing
NIfTI-class objects to disk, the XML-based NIfTI extension is
converted into plain text and saved appropriately.

It should be noted that at this time objects that are written out in
NIfTI format with extensions created by \pkg{decmriS4} will not be
properly read into FSLView
(\url{http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslview/}).  If you prefer to
visualize multidimensional arrays in FSLView, please use the command

<<NIfTI.audit.trail,eval=FALSE>>=
options(NIfTI.audit.trail=FALSE)
@

to turn off the ``audit trail'' option in \pkg{dcemriS4}.  We are
actively working to better understand how FSLView interprets NIfTI
header extensions with the goal of full integration.  An alternative
viewing platform is available via MRIcroN
(\url{http://www.sph.sc.edu/comd/rorden/MRicron/}).

\subsection{Examples}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Labelled LR Standard (MNI152) Images in NIfTI Format}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The first example of reading in, and displaying, medical imaging data
in NIfTI format (\texttt{avg152T1\_LR\_nifti.nii.gz}) was obtained
from the NIfTI website (\url{nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/}).  
Successful execution of the command:

<<avg152T1_LR_nifti>>=
mni.LR <- readNIfTI(system.file("nifti/avg152T1_LR_nifti.nii.gz", 
                                package="dcemriS4"))
mni.LR
audit.trail(mni.LR)
descrip(mni.LR)
@ 
<<figure1-png,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
png(filename="avg152T1_LR_nifti.png", width=400, height=400, bg="black")
@ 
<<figure1-code>>=
image(mni.LR)
@ 
<<figure1-dev.off,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
dev.off()
@ 

produces a 4D array of the image data, with the default NIfTI axes,
and is displayed on a $10{\times}10$ grid of images
(Figure~\ref{fig:avg152T1_LR_nifti}).  Note, the \code{image} function
has been modified to accept \code{nifti} and \code{anlz} objects and
display them with minimal user input.  Two accessor functions are also
shown here: \code{audit.trail} and \code{descrip}.  The former is used
to access the XML-based audit trail that is stored as a NIfTI header
extension and the latter is the name of a valid NIfTI header field
(allowed to store up to 80 characters).

  \caption{Axial slices of MNI volume \texttt{avg152T1\_LR\_nifti}

  \label{fig:avg152T1_LR_nifti}
\end{figure}

The second example of reading in, and displaying, medical imaging data
in NIfTI format (\texttt{avg152T1\_RL\_nifti.nii}) was also obtained
from the NIfTI website (\url{nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/}).
Successful execution of the command

<<avg152T1_RL_nifti>>=
mni.RL <- readNIfTI(system.file("nifti/avg152T1_RL_nifti.nii.gz", 
                                package="dcemriS4"))
mni.RL
@ 
<<figure2-png,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
png(filename="avg152T1_RL_nifti.png", width=400, height=400, bg="black")
@ 
<<figure2-code>>=
image(mni.RL)
<<figure2-dev.off,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
dev.off()
@ 

produces a 4D array of the image data that may be displayed in a
$10{\times}10$ grid of images (Figure~\ref{fig:avg152T1_RL_nifti}).

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering

  \caption{Axial slices of MNI volume \texttt{avg152T1\_RL\_nifti}

  \label{fig:avg152T1_RL_nifti}
\end{figure}

The first image (LR) is stored in radiological convention.  The second
image (RL) is stored in neurological convention.  Any NIfTI-1 compliant
viewing software should display these images identically.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Simple Time-series or Multi-volume Image}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is an example of reading in, and displaying, a four-dimensional
medical imaging data set in NIfTI format
(\texttt{filtered\_func\_data.nii}) obtained from the NIfTI website
(\url{nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/}).  Successful execution of the
command

<<filtered_func_data>>=
ffd <- readNIfTI(system.file("nifti/filtered_func_data.nii.gz", 
                             package="dcemriS4"))
ffd
@ 
<<figure3-png,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
png(filename="ffd.png", width=400, height=400, bg="black")
@ 
<<figure3-code>>=
image(ffd)
@ 
<<figure3-dev.off,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
dev.off()
@ 

produces a four-dimensional (4D) array of imaging data that may be
displayed in a $5{\times}5$ grid of images (Figure~\ref{fig:ffd}).
The first three dimensions are spatial locations of the voxel (volume
element) and the fourth dimension is time.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{ffd.png}
  \caption{Axial slices of the functional MRI ``volume''
  \texttt{filtered\_func\_data} from the first acquisition.}
  \label{fig:ffd}
\end{figure}

An additional graphical display function has been added for
\code{nifti} and \code{anlz} objects that allows orthographic displays.

<<figure3b-png,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
png(filename="ffd_orthographic.png", width=400, height=400, bg="black")
@ 
<<figure3b-code>>=
orthographic(ffd)
@ 
<<figure3b-dev.off,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
dev.off()
@ 

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{ffd_orthographic.png}
  \caption{Orthographic display of the first volume from the
  functional MRI dataset \texttt{filtered\_func\_data}.  By default
  the mid-axial, mid-saggittal and mid-coronal planes are chosen.}
  \label{fig:ffd-orthographic}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Statistic Image}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is an example of reading in and displaying a statistical image so
that it may be overlayed on the EPI (echo planar imaging) data taken
from the functional MRI experiment.  The original NIfTI files
(\texttt{filtered\_func\_data.nii} and \texttt{zstat1.nii}) were
obtained from the NIfTI website (\url{nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/}).
Successful execution of the command

<<zstat1>>=
zstat1 <- readNIfTI(system.file("nifti/zstat1.nii.gz", package="dcemriS4"))
zstat1
@ 
<<figure4-png,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
png("ffd_zstat1.png", width=400, height=400, bg="black")
@ 
<<figure4-code>>=
overlay(ffd, ifelse(abs(zstat1) > 5, zstat1, NA), zlim.y=range(zstat1))
<<figure4-dev.off,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
dev.off()
@ 
produces a 4D array of parameter estimates (essentially coefficients
from a linear regression performed at each voxel) that may be
overlayed on the original data for anatomical reference
(Figure~\ref{fig:zstat1}).  The function \code{overlay} extends the
capabilities of displaying ``images'' by allowing one to add a
statistical image to an underlying structural image.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{ffd_zstat1.png}
  \caption{Axial slices of the functional MRI data with 
  with the statistical image overlayed.  The test statistics were
  thresholded at $|Z|\geq{5}$.}

\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Motion Correction and Co-registration}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Basic motion correction within an acquisition, and co-registration
between acquired series, is available using template matching
(\url{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_matching}).  A reference volume
must be pre-specified where a mask has been applied to remove all
voxels that should not be included in the algorithm.  Note, only
three-dimensional translations are allowed and no interpolation is
used (i.e., only whole-voxel translations) at this time.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{T1 Relaxation and Gadolinium Concentration}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Estimation of the tissue T1 relaxation rate is the first step in
converting signal intensity, obtained in the dynamic acquisition of
the DCE-MRI protocol, to contrast agent concentration.  The subsequent
steps provided here focus on pharmacokinetic modeling and assumes one
has converted the dynamic acquisition to contrast agent concentration.
Please see \cite{col-pad:ieee} for a discussion on this point.

There are a myriad of techniques to quantify T1 using MRI.  Currently
curve-fitting methods for two popular acquisition schemes are
available
\begin{itemize}
\item Inversion recovery (\url{www.e-mri.org/mri-sequences/inversion-recovery-stir-flair.html})
\item Multiple flip angles \citep{par-pad:DCE-MRI}
\end{itemize}
Once the tissue T1 relaxation rate has been estimated, the dynamic
acquisition is then converted to contrast agent concentration.  Note,
the B1 field is assumed to be constant (and accurate) when using
multiple flip angles to estimate T1.  At higher fields strengths
(e.g., 3T) the B1 field should be estimated in order to correct the
prescribed flip angles.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{B1 Mapping Via the Saturated Double-Angle Method}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For in vivo MRI at high field ($\geq{3}$Tesla) it is essential to
consider the homogeneity of the active B1 field (B1+).  The B1+ field
is the transverse, circularly polarized component of B1 that is
rotating in the same sense as the magnetization.  When exciting or
manipulating large collections of spins, non-uniformity in B1+ results
in nonuniform treatment of spins.  This leads to spatially varying
image signal and image contrast and to difficulty in image
interpretation and image-based quantification
\citep{cun-pau-nay:saturated}.

The proposed method uses an adaptation of the double angle method
(DAM).  Such methods allow calculation of a flip-angle map, which is
an indirect measure of the B1+ field.  Two images are acquired:
$I_1$ with prescribed tip $\alpha_1$ and $I_2$ with prescribed tip
$\alpha_2=2\alpha_1$.  All other signal-affecting sequence parameters
are kept constant. For each voxel, the ratio of magnitude images
satisfies
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{I_2(r)}{I_1(r)} =
  \frac{\sin\alpha_2(r)f_2(T_1,\text{TR})}{\sin\alpha_1(r)f_1(T_1,\text{TR})}
\end{equation*}
where $r$ represents spatial position and $alpha_1(r)$ and
$\alpha_2(r)$ are tip angles that vary with the spatially varying B1+
field.  If the effects of $T_1$ and $T_2$ relaxation can be neglected,
then the actual tip angles as a function of spatial position satisfy
\begin{equation*}
  \alpha(r) = \text{arccos}\left(\left|\frac{I_2(r)}{2I_1(r)}\right|\right)
\end{equation*}
A long repetition time ($\text{TR}\leq{5T_1}$) is typically used with
the double-angle methods so that there is no $T_1$ dependence in
either $I_1$ or $I_2$ (i.e.,
$f_1(T_1,\text{TR})=f_2(T_1,\text{TR})=1.0$.  Instead, the proposed
method includes a magnetization-reset sequence after each data
acquisition with the goal of putting the spin population in the same
state regardless of whether the or $\alpha_2$ excitation was used for
the preceding acquisition (i.e.,
$f_1(T_1,\text{TR})=f_2(T_1,\text{TR})\ne{1.0}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Example}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Using data acquired from a T1 phantom at two flip angles,
$\alpha_1=60^\circ$ and $\alpha_2=120^\circ$, we compute the
multiplicative factor relative to the low flip angle using the
saturated double-angle method \citep{cun-pau-nay:saturated}.
  
<<doubleanglemethod>>=
sdam60 <- readNIfTI(system.file("nifti/SDAM_ep2d_60deg_26slc.nii.gz",

sdam60
sdam120 <- readNIfTI(system.file("nifti/SDAM_ep2d_120deg_26slc.nii.gz", 
                                 package="dcemriS4"))
sdam120
sdam.image <- rowMeans(dam(sdam60, sdam120, 60), dims=3)
mask <- (rowSums(sdam60, dims=3) > 500) # nifti(rowSums(sdam60, dims=3) > 500)

overlay(sdam120, ifelse(mask, SDAM, NA), z=13, zlim.x=range(sdam120), 
        zlim.y=c(0.5,1.5), plot.type="single")

Figure~\ref{fig:sdam} is the estimated B1+ field (with isotropic
Gaussian smoothing) for a gel-based phantom containing a variety of T1
relaxation times.  The center of the phantom exhibits a flip angle
$>60^\circ$ while the flip angle rapidly becomes $<60^\circ$ when
moving away from the center in either the $x$, $y$ or $z$ dimensions.
Isotropic smoothing should be applied before using this field to
modify flip angles associated with additional acquisitions (e.g., in
the \pkg{AnalyzeFMRI} package).
  
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics*[width=.5\textwidth]{sdam.png}

    using the saturated double-angle method.  The colors correspond to
    a multiplicative factor relative to the true flip angle
    ($60^\circ$).}
  \label{fig:sdam}
\end{figure}

Assuming the smoothed version of the B1+ field has been computed
(\code{SDAM}), multiple flip-angle acquisitions can be used to estimate
the T1 relaxation rate from the subject (or phantom).  The
multiplicative factor, derived from the saturated double-angle method,
is used to produce a spatially-varying flip-angle map and input into
the appropriate function.

We may compare the ``true'' T1 values for each ROI with those obtained
from acquiring multiple flip angles with the application of B1
mapping.  Figure~\ref{fig:t1-phantom-boxplot} compares T1 estimates in
the 10 ROIs, defined by \code{pmask}, with the true T1 values (large
circles).  The first seven ROIs correspond to the cylinders that run
around the phantom, clockwise starting from approximately one o'clock.
The eighth and ninth ROIs are taken from the main compartment in the
phantom; ROI eight is drawn in the middle of the phantom while ROI
nine is drawn from the outside of the phantom.  The final ROI is taken
from the central cylinder embedded in the phantom.

\subsection{Contrast Agent Concentration}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \code{CA.fast} function rearranges the assumed multidimensional
(2D or 3D) structure of the multiple flip-angle data into a single
matrix to take advantage of internal R functions instead of loops, and
called \code{E10.lm}.  Conversion of the dynamic signal intensities to
contrast agent concentration is performed via
\begin{equation*}
  [\text{Gd}] = \frac{1}{r_1}\left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_{10}}\right),
\end{equation*}
where $r_1$ is the spin-lattice relaxivity constant and $T_{10}$ is
the spin-lattice relaxation time in the absence of contrast media
\citep{buc-par:measuring}.  For computational reasons, we follow the
method of \cite{li-etal:improved}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Arterial Input Function}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Whereas quantitative PET studies routinely perform arterial
cannulation on the subject in order to characterize the arterial input
function (AIF), it has been common to use literature-based AIFs in the
DCE-MRI literature.  Examples include
\begin{equation*}
  C_p(t) = D \left( a_1 e^{-m_1t} + a_2 e^{-m_2t} \right),
\end{equation*}
where $D=0.1\,\text{mmol/kg}$, $a_1=3.99\,\text{kg/l}$,
$a_2=4.78\,\text{kg/l}$, $m_1=0.144\,\text{min}^{-1}$ and
$m_2=0.0111\,\text{min}^{-1}$
\citep{wei-lan-mut:pharmacokinetics,tof-ker:measurement}; or
$D=1.0\,\text{mmol/kg}$, $a_1=2.4\,\text{kg/l}$,
$a_2=0.62\,\text{kg/l}$, $m_1=3.0$ and $m_2=0.016$
\citep{fri-etal:measurement}.  There has been progress in measuring
the AIF using the dynamic acquisition and fitting a parametric model
to the observed data.  Recent models include \cite{par-etal:derived}
and \cite{ort-etal:efficient}.  \pkg{dcemri} has incorporated one of
these parametric models from \cite{ort-etal:efficient}
\begin{eqnarray*}

  e^{-\mu_Bt}\right)%\\
  %C_p(t) &=& \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
  %a_B \left( 1 - \cos(\mu_Bt)\right) + a_B a_G f(t,\mu_G) &
  %0\leq{t}\leq{t_B}\\
  %a_B a_G f(t,\mu_G) e^{-\mu_G(t - t_B)} & t > t_B
  %\end{array}\right.
\end{eqnarray*}
which can be fitted to the observed data using nonlinear regression.
Using the AIF defined in \cite{buc:uncertainty}, we illustrate fitting
a parametric model to characterize observed data.  The
\code{orton.exp.lm} function provides this capability using a common
double-exponential parametric form.

\section{Kinetic Parameter Estimation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The standard Kety model \citep{ket:blood-tissue}, a single-compartment
model, or the extended Kety model, the standard Kety model with an
extra ``vascular'' term, form the collection of basic parametric
models one can apply using \pkg{dcemri}.  Regardless of which
parametric model is chosen for the biological system, the contrast
agent concentration curve at each voxel in the region of interest
(ROI) is approximated using the convolution of an arterial input
function (AIF) and the compartmental model; e.g.,
\begin{eqnarray*}
  C_t(t) & = & \ktrans \left[ C_p(t) \otimes e^{-\kep t} \right],\\
  C_t(t) & = & \vp C_P(t) + \ktrans \left[ C_p(t) \otimes e^{-\kep t}
    \right].
\end{eqnarray*}

Parameter estimation is achieved using one of two options in the
current version of this software:
\begin{itemize}
\item Non-linear regression using non-linear least squares
  (Levenburg-Marquardt optimization)
\item Bayesian estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
  \citep{sch-etal:TMI}
\end{itemize}
Least-square estimates of the kinetic parameters $\ktrans$ and $\kep$
(also $\vp$ for the extended Kety model) are provided in
\code{dcemri.lm} while the posterior median is provided in
\code{dcemri.bayes}.  When using Bayesian estimation all samples from
the joint posterior distribution are also provided, allowing one to
interrogate the empirical probability density function (PDF) of the
parameter estimates.

Using the simulated breast data from \cite{buc:uncertainty}, we
illustrate fitting the ``extended Kety'' model to the contrast agent
concentration curves using the exponential model for the AIF.  We use
non-linear regression to fit the data on an under-sampled subset (in
time) of
the simulated curves.

<<buckley.kinetic>>=
xi <- seq(5, 300, by=5)
img <- array(t(breast$data)[,xi], c(13,1,1,60))
time <- buckley$time.min[xi]
aif <- buckley$input[xi]
mask <- array(TRUE, dim(img)[1:3])
aifparams <- orton.exp.lm(time, aif)
fit <- dcemri.lm(img, time, mask, model="orton.exp",
                 aif="user", user=aifparams)

for (x in 1:nrow(img)) {
  plot(time, img[x,1,1,], ylim=range(img), xlab="Time (minutes)",
       ylab="", main=paste("Series", x))
  kinparams <- with(fit, c(vp[x,1,1], ktrans[x,1,1], kep[x,1,1]))
  lines(time, model.orton.exp(time, aifparams[1:4], kinparams), 
        lwd=1.5, col=2)

  breast tissue, with the best parametric fit using an exponential
  model for the AIF and the ``extended Kety'' model.}
\label{fig:fitted-kinetic}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:fitted-kinetic} displays the 13 unique simulated
curves along with the fitted curves from the compartmental model.
There is decent agreement between the observed and fitted values,
except for Series~6 which changes too rapidly in the beginning and
cannot be explained by the parametric model.

\section{Statistical Inference}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

No specific support is provided for hypothesis testing in
\pkg{dcemri}.  We recommend one uses built-in facilities in
\proglang{R} to perform ANOVA (analysis of variance) or mixed-effects
models based on statistical summaries of the kinetic parameters over
the ROI per subject per visit.  An alternative to this traditional
approach is to analyze an entire study using a Bayesian hierarchical
model \citep{sch-etal:hierarchical}, available in the software project
\pkg{PILFER} (\url{pilfer.sourceforge.net}).

One may also question the rationale for hypothesis testing in only one
kinetic parameter.  Preliminary work has been performed in looking at
the joint response to treatment of both $\ktrans$ and $\kep$ in
DCE-MRI by \cite{oco-etal:fPCA}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Diffusion Weighted Imaging}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), also known as diffusion-weighted MRI
(DW-MRI), is a technique that measures the Brownian motion of water
molecules to estimate the diffusion characteristics of tissue \emph{in
vivo} \citep{mos-etal:diffusion,bux:introduction}.  Contrast is
generated when the diffusion of molecules in tissue prefer a specific
direction in three-dimenisonal space (anisotropic diffusion) relative
to any particular direction (isotropic diffusion).  Using the
Stejskal--Tanner equation
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{S}{S_0} =
  \exp\left(-\gamma^2G^2\delta^2(\Delta-\delta/3)D\right) =
  \exp\left(-bD\right),
\end{equation*}
one may solve for the unknown diffusion to obtain the \emph{apparent
diffusion coefficient} (ADC) $D$.  For completeness, $S_0$ is the
signal intensity without the diffusion weighting, $S$ is the signal
with the gradient applied, $\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio, $G$ is
the strength of the gradient pulse, $\delta$ is the duration of the
gradient pulse and $\Delta$ is the time between the two pulses.  The
functions \code{ADC.fast} and \code{adc.lm} perform parameter
estimation using a similar interface to kinetic parameter estimation
previously introduced for DCE-MRI.

DWI is under rapid development as an oncology imaging biomarker
\citep{che-etal:diffusion,koh-col:DW-MRI}.  The diffusion of water
without restrictions is about
$3.0{\times}10^{-3}\;\text{mm}^2/\text{s}$.  Once the ADC is estimated
in the tumor of interest at baseline, treatment response may be
assessed at subsequent time points.  The most appropriate timings
depend on both the type of tumor and treatment regime.  Observing an
decrease in diffusivity, via a decrease in the ADC values
post-treatment, may be a result of cell swelling after ititial
chemotherapy or radiotherapy followed by an increase in diffusivity,
via an increase in the ADC values, from cell necrosis and lysis.  A
decrease in ADC values may be observed directly through tumor
apoptosis after treatment.
