\section{Introduction}

Quantitative analysis of perfusion imaging using dynamic
contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is achieved through a series of
processing steps, starting with the raw data acquired from the MRI
scanner, and involves a combination of physics, mathematics,
engineering and statistics.  The purpose of the \pkg{dcemriS4} package
is to provide a collection of functions that move the experimental
data through all steps of the data analysis pipeline using standard
data formats that may be visualized and manipulated across a wide
variety of software packages.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Data Input/Output}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Data Formats and Conversion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \pkg{dcemriS4} package requires incoming data to be in
the ANALYZE~7.5 or NIfTI formats.  Data conversion (e.g., from DICOM
to NIfTI) must be performed by the user before \pkg{dcemriS4} may be
used to summarize the data.  Several software packages allow
DICOM-to-NIfTI (or ANALYZE) conversion; e.g.,
\begin{itemize}
\item FreeSurfer (\url{surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu})
\item Xmedcon (\url{xmedcon.sourceforge.net})
\item MRIConvert (\url{lnci.oregon.edu/\~jolinda/MRIConvert})
\end{itemize}
This is by no means an exhaustive list of software available for DICOM
conversion.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{A Note on Axes and Orientation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The NIfTI format contains an implicit generalized spatial
transformation from the data co-ordinate system $(i,j,k)$ into a
real-space ``right-handed'' co-ordinate system.  In this real-space
system, the $(x,y,z)$ axes are \emph{usually} set such that $x$
increases from left to right, $y$ increases from posterior to anterior
and $z$ increases from inferior to superior.

At this point in time the \pkg{dcemriS4} package cannot apply an
arbitrary transform to the imaging data into $(x,y,z)$ space -- such a
transform may require non-integral indices and interpolation steps.
The package does accommodate straightforward transformations of imaging
data; e.g., setting the $x$-axis to increase from right to left
(neurological).  Future versions of \pkg{dcemriS4} will attempt to
address more complicated transformations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Labelled LR Standard (MNI152) Images in NIfTI Format}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The first example of reading in, and displaying, medical imaging data
in NIfTI format (\texttt{avg152T1\_LR\_nifti.nii.gz}) was obtained
from the NIfTI website (\url{nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/}).  
Successful execution of the command:

<<avg152T1_LR_nifti>>=
mni.LR <- readNIfTI(system.file("nifti/avg152T1_LR_nifti.nii.gz", 
                                package="dcemriS4"))
mni.LR
@ 
<<figure1-png,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
png(filename="avg152T1_LR_nifti.png", width=400, height=400, bg="black")
@ 
<<figure1-code>>=
image(mni.LR)
@ 
<<figure1-dev.off,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
dev.off()
@ 

produces a 4D array of the image data, with the default NIfTI axes,
and is displayed on a $10{\times}10$ grid of images
(Figure~\ref{fig:avg152T1_LR_nifti}).

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

  \includegraphics{avg152T1_LR_nifti.png}
  \caption{Axial slices of MNI volume \texttt{avg152T1\_LR\_nifti}
  stored in radiological convention.}
  \label{fig:avg152T1_LR_nifti}
\end{figure}

The second example of reading in, and displaying, medical imaging data
in NIfTI format (\texttt{avg152T1\_RL\_nifti.nii}) was also obtained
from the NIfTI website (\url{nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/}).
Successful execution of the command

<<avg152T1_RL_nifti>>=
mni.RL <- readNIfTI(system.file("nifti/avg152T1_RL_nifti.nii.gz", 
                                package="dcemriS4"))
mni.RL
@ 
<<figure2-png,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
png(filename="avg152T1_RL_nifti.png", width=400, height=400, bg="black")
@ 
<<figure2-code>>=
image(mni.RL)
<<figure2-dev.off,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
dev.off()
@ 

produces a 4D array of the image data that may be displayed in a
$10{\times}10$ grid of images (Figure~\ref{fig:avg152T1_RL_nifti}).

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{avg152T1_RL_nifti.png}
  \caption{Axial slices of MNI volume \texttt{avg152T1\_RL\_nifti}
  stored in neurological convention.}
  \label{fig:avg152T1_RL_nifti}
\end{figure}

The first image (LR) is stored in radiological convention.  The second
image (RL) is stored in neurological convention.  Any NIfTI-1 compliant
viewing software should display these images identically.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Simple Time-series or Multi-volume Image}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is an example of reading in, and displaying, a four-dimensional
medical imaging data set in NIfTI format
(\texttt{filtered\_func\_data.nii}) obtained from the NIfTI website
(\url{nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/}).  Successful execution of the
command

<<filtered_func_data>>=
ffd <- readNIfTI(system.file("nifti/filtered_func_data.nii.gz", 
                             package="dcemriS4"))
ffd
@ 
<<figure3-png,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
png(filename="ffd.png", width=400, height=400, bg="black")
@ 
<<figure3-code>>=
image(ffd)
@ 
<<figure3-dev.off,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
dev.off()
@ 

produces a four-dimensional (4D) array of imaging data that may be
displayed in a $5{\times}5$ grid of images (Figure~\ref{fig:ffd}).
The first three dimensions are spatial locations of the voxel (volume
element) and the fourth dimension is time.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{ffd.png}
  \caption{Axial slices of the functional MRI ``volume''
  \texttt{filtered\_func\_data} from the first acquisition.}
  \label{fig:ffd}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Statistic Image}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is an example of reading in and displaying a statistical image so
that it may be overlayed on the EPI (echo planar imaging) data taken
from the functional MRI experiment.  The original NIfTI files
(\texttt{filtered\_func\_data.nii} and \texttt{zstat1.nii}) were
obtained from the NIfTI website (\url{nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/}).
Successful execution of the command

<<zstat1>>=
zstat1 <- readNIfTI(system.file("nifti/zstat1.nii.gz", package="dcemriS4"))
zstat1
@ 
<<figure4-png,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
png("ffd_zstat1.png", width=400, height=400, bg="black")
@ 
<<figure4-code>>=
overlay(ffd, ifelse(abs(zstat1) > 5, zstat1, NA), zlim.y=range(zstat1))
<<figure4-dev.off,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
dev.off()
@ 
produces a 4D array of parameter estimates (essentially coefficients
from a linear regression performed at each voxel) that may be
overlayed on the original data for anatomical reference
(Figure~\ref{fig:zstat1}).

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{ffd_zstat1.png}
  \caption{Axial slices of the functional MRI data with 
  with the statistical image overlayed.  The test statistics were
  thresholded at $|Z|\geq{4}$.}
  \label{fig:zstat1}
\end{figure}

\section{Motion Correction and Co-registration}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Basic motion correction within an acquisition, and co-registration
between acquired series, is available using template matching
(\url{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_matching}).  A reference volume
must be pre-specified where a mask has been applied to remove all
voxels that should not be included in the algorithm.  Note, only
three-dimensional translations are allowed and no interpolation is
used (i.e., only whole-voxel translations) at this time.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{T1 Relaxation and Gadolinium Concentration}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Estimation of the tissue T1 relaxation rate is the first step in
converting signal intensity, obtained in the dynamic acquisition of
the DCE-MRI protocol, to contrast agent concentration.  The subsequent
steps provided here focus on pharmacokinetic modeling and assumes one
has converted the dynamic acquisition to contrast agent concentration.
Please see \cite{col-pad:ieee} for a discussion on this point.

There are a myriad of techniques to quantify T1 using MRI.  Currently
curve-fitting methods for two popular acquisition schemes are
available
\begin{itemize}
\item Inversion recovery (\url{www.e-mri.org/mri-sequences/inversion-recovery-stir-flair.html})
\item Multiple flip angles \citep{par-pad:DCE-MRI}
\end{itemize}
Once the tissue T1 relaxation rate has been estimated, the dynamic
acquisition is then converted to contrast agent concentration.  Note,
the B1 field is assumed to be constant (and accurate) when using
multiple flip angles to estimate T1.  At higher fields strengths
(e.g., 3T) the B1 field should be estimated in order to correct the
prescribed flip angles.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{B1 Mapping Via the Saturated Double-Angle Method}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For in vivo MRI at high field ($\geq{3}$Tesla) it is essential to
consider the homogeneity of the active B1 field (B1+).  The B1+ field
is the transverse, circularly polarized component of B1 that is
rotating in the same sense as the magnetization.  When exciting or
manipulating large collections of spins, non-uniformity in B1+ results
in nonuniform treatment of spins.  This leads to spatially varying
image signal and image contrast and to difficulty in image
interpretation and image-based quantification
\citep{cun-pau-nay:saturated}.

The proposed method uses an adaptation of the double angle method
(DAM).  Such methods allow calculation of a flip-angle map, which is
an indirect measure of the B1+ field.  Two images are acquired:
$I_1$ with prescribed tip $\alpha_1$ and $I_2$ with prescribed tip
$\alpha_2=2\alpha_1$.  All other signal-affecting sequence parameters
are kept constant. For each voxel, the ratio of magnitude images
satisfies
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{I_2(r)}{I_1(r)} =
  \frac{\sin\alpha_2(r)f_2(T_1,\text{TR})}{\sin\alpha_1(r)f_1(T_1,\text{TR})}
\end{equation*}
where $r$ represents spatial position and $alpha_1(r)$ and
$\alpha_2(r)$ are tip angles that vary with the spatially varying B1+
field.  If the effects of $T_1$ and $T_2$ relaxation can be neglected,
then the actual tip angles as a function of spatial position satisfy
\begin{equation*}
  \alpha(r) = \text{arccos}\left(\left|\frac{I_2(r)}{2I_1(r)}\right|\right)
\end{equation*}
A long repetition time ($\text{TR}\leq{5T_1}$) is typically used with
the double-angle methods so that there is no $T_1$ dependence in
either $I_1$ or $I_2$ (i.e.,
$f_1(T_1,\text{TR})=f_2(T_1,\text{TR})=1.0$.  Instead, the proposed
method includes a magnetization-reset sequence after each data
acquisition with the goal of putting the spin population in the same
state regardless of whether the or $\alpha_2$ excitation was used for
the preceding acquisition (i.e.,
$f_1(T_1,\text{TR})=f_2(T_1,\text{TR})\ne{1.0}$.
